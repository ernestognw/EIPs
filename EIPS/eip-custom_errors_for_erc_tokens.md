## Abstract

The following specification allows for the use of a standard list of Solidity custom errors to be used by [EIP-20](./eip-20.md), [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens.

Ethereum applications (DApps) and wallets have historically relied on revert reason strings to show the cause of transaction errors to users. More recent Solidity versions offer rich revert reasons that require error-specific decoding. This EIP defines a standard set of errors designed to give at least the same relevant information as revert reason strings, but in a structured and expected way that clients can implement decoding for.

## Motivation

Since the introduction of Solidity custom errors in v0.8.4, these have provided a way to show failures in a more expresive way with dynamic arguments, while reducing deployment costs.

At the moment of the release of custom errors, the standard tokens ([EIP-20](./eip-20.md), [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md)) were already in finalized state, so no errors are included in their specification.

An error specification will allow users to expect more consistent error messages across applications or testing environments, while exposing pertinent arguments and overall reducing the need of writing expensive revert strings in the deployment bytecode.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

The provided interfaces with errors SHOULD conform with the [error grammar rules](#error-grammar-rules) described in the [rationale](#rationale) section.

This EIP defines standard errors that may be used by implementations in certain scenarios, but does not specify whether implementations should revert in those scenarios, which remains up to the implementers, unless a revert is mandated by the corresponding EIPs.

The names of the error arguments follow the [parameter glossary](#parameter-glossary) section, defining a clear guideline for assigning values to them.

### Error additions

Any addition to this EIP is considerred a new proposal, but SHOULD follow the guidelines presented in the [rationale](#rationale) section to keep consistency.

## Rationale

The objectives of creating a standard for token errors are to provide context about the error, while keeping gramatical sense, and making a moderated use of meaningful arguments.

Considering the outlined above, the errors are designed based on the standard actions that can be performed on each token, and the [subjects](#actions-and-subjects) involved.

### Actions and subjects

The main actions that can be performed within a token are:

- **Transfer**: An operation in which a _sender_ moves any form of _balance_ to a _receiver_.
- **Approval**: An operation in which an _approver_ grants any form of _approval_ to an _operator_.

Whose subjects outlined are expected to be exhaustive to represent _what_ can go wrong in a transaction, which can be shown as an error by adding a [failure prefix](#error-prefixes).

Note that `Token` or `TokenID` MUST NOT be a subject for the following reasons:

1. The [Domain](#domain) is explicit enough to identify it as a token error.
2. Although `TokenID` may identify an error, the token itself SHOULD NOT the root of the error, but can be additional information.

Consider that, in practice, some of the subjects in a contract might be called different while they represent the same. These are listed below:

- **Balance**: Represents the access to a certain amount of tokens for an address.
  - EIP-721: Instead of _balance_, an address is _owner_ of a token.
- **Approval**: Represents a permission granted to an operator.
  - EIP-20: Instead of _approval_, an operator has _allowance_.
- **Operator**: Represents an address that has received approval over third-party tokens.
  - EIP-20: Instead of _operator_, an address with allowance is an _spender_.

If a subject is called different on a particular token standard, the error MUST be consistent with the standard's naming convention.

### Error prefixes

An error prefix is what complements a subject, so it can be read as an error.
Developers can think about an error prefix as the _why_ an error happened.

A prefix can be `Invalid` for general incorrectness, or more specific like `Insufficient` for amounts (or lack of).

### Domain

Although these errors are considered to be expressive enough, each error's arguments may vary depending on the token domain, causing a `DeclarationError` if there are errors with the same name and different arguments.

An example of this is:

```solidity
InsufficientApproval(address spender, uint256 allowance, uint256 needed);
InsufficientApproval(address operator, uint256 tokenId);
```

For that reason, a domain prefix is proposed to avoid declaration clashing, which is the name of the ERC and its corresponding number appended at the beginning.

Example:

```solidity
ERC20InsufficientApproval(address spender, uint256 allowance, uint256 needed);
ERC721InsufficientApproval(address operator, uint256 tokenId);
```

### Arguments

The selection of arguments depends on the subject involved, and it MUST follow the order presented below:

1. _Who_ is involved with the error (an `address`) - _REQUIRED_
2. _What_ failed (eg. `uint256 allowance`) - _OPTIONAL_
3. _Why_ it failed, expressed in additional arguments (eg. `uint256 needed`) - _OPTIONAL_

Consider that sometimes _Who_ is also the _What_, that's why argument 2 is also optional.

Note: Some tokens may need a `tokenId` or `id`. This is suggested to include at the end as additional information, according to the [subjects notes](#actions-and-subjects)

### Error grammar rules

Given the above, we can summarize the construction of error names with a grammar that errors MUST follow:

```
<Domain><ErrorPrefix><Subject>(<Arguments>);
```

Where:

- _Domain_: SHOULD be `ERC20`, `ERC721` or `ERC1155`. Although other token standards may be suggested if not considered in this EIP.
- _ErrorPrefix_: MAY be `Invalid`, `Insufficient`, or another if it's more appropiated.
- _Subject_: MAY be `Sender`, `Receiver`, `Balance`, `Approver`, `Operator`, `Approval` or another if it's more appropiated, and MUST make adjustments based on domain's naming convention.
- _Arguments_: MUST follow the [_who_, _what_ and _why_ order](#arguments).

## Backwards Compatibility

<!-- All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright. -->

This EIP can not be enforced on non-upgradeable already deployed tokens, however, these tokens generally use similar conventions with small variations such as:

- including/removing the [domain](#domain).
- using different [error prefixes](#error-prefixes).
- including similar [subjects](#actions-and-subjects).
- changing the grammar order.

New deployed contracts MUST use this EIP whenever possible. Errors in extensions are not considered in this EIP and MAY have different subjects.

Upgradeable contracts MAY be upgraded to implement this EIP.

Implementers and DApp developers SHOULD expect these EIP errors to be present on new deployed contracts, but MUST handle variation errors for existing contracts, and revert strings that may be returned.

## Reference Implementation

<!-- An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification. If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. -->

## Security Considerations

There are no known signature hash collision for the specified errors.

Tokens upgraded to implement this EIP may break assumptions in other systems relying on revert strings.
